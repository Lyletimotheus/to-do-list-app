# Building A Simple To Do List using PHP

The aim of this project is to build a simple to do list application that allows users to add, update and delete tasks following CRUD operations. 
We wanted to better understand how the technologies work together. 

## Technologies
- MYSQL 10.4.13-MariaDB
- PHP 7
- HTML 5 
- CSS 3
- JavaScript 

## Features 
- The user will be able to add a task to the database.
- The user will be able to edit a task, which will also be updated in the database.
- The user will be able to delete a task, which will be removed from the database as well. 

## Future Functionality
- We will be adding AJAX functionality later on to reduce the number of page reloads, when the user adds or updates a task.
- A calender will be implemented to show the user their list of upcoming deadlines. It will be colored coded to show the user deadlines according to importance.

## Security
- Care should be taken when using this code in production as we've built this app for pure functionality and have not reviewed all the security aspects. 
- It is not recommend to use this code in production.
